# General

Hello everyone!
My name is Anastasiia and I begin my journey to software development world. I've chosen Python as my first programming language due to its widespread and frientliness. I'm already very excited and eager to gain a new knowledge about both python and software development in general. This is my first ever repository ever and I hope for your understanding and help with your reasonable and constructive critics. All your advices are much appreciated!

# Description

I would like to give a brief description of well (as well as not so well) known programming issues solved by me here.
### blackjack.py
This is my text implementatation of well-known "21" or "blackjack" card game
### chain_words.py
This is a well-known 'chain words' or 'words ladder' problem: we have a dictionary with a set of words and we are trying to find out if it's possible to transform one given word to another by changing just one letter in a word assuming that each word should be in a given dictionary. Everyone knows it's a BFS but it doesn't make this particular task less cooler!
### coordinate.py
This is my small contribution to one of my passions: video games. We have a reactangular map indicating whether we can step on the tile or not; we have a starting and target ponts and we need to detect if we can reach given destination and if we can how many step we should take to do this.
### shift_list.py
This is another well-known but still exciting task: rotate ~~an array~~ a list by given amount of steps.
### tic_tac_toe.py
I hope this is self-explanatory: this is just my implementation of a well-known tic-tac-toe game.
